# Advent of Code 2023

My first time trying advent of code.

> main goal is be constant through the 25 days!

## _thoughts_

*AOC 1:* The first part was very easy, the second introduced an interesting edge case(nightmares about "TWONE").

*AOC 2:* Both parts felt balanced, I really enjoyed doing it!

*AOC 3:* Oof, this was a hard one for me, working with matrices-a-like structures always have been my weak point. You can even notice that by how bad my code is in part-01 lol... It got better(not much sadly) after a long break before coding part-02, I don't think I'm going back to refactor part-01 tho xD

*AOC 4:* Just like AOC 2, this one felt balanced in both parts, in fact it took less than an hour to be done!
