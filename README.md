# Advent of Code 2023

My first time trying advent of code.

> main goal is be constant through the 25 days!

## _thoughts_

*AOC 1:* The first part was very easy, the second introduced an interesting edge case(nightmares about "TWONE").

*AOC 2:* Both parts felt balanced, I really enjoyed doing it!

*AOC 3:* Oof, this was a hard one for me, working with matrices-a-like structures always have been my weak point. You can even notice that by how bad my code is in part-01 lol... It got better(not much sadly) after a long break before coding part-02, I don't think I'm going back to refactor part-01 tho xD

*AOC 4:* Just like AOC 2, this one felt balanced in both parts, in fact it took less than an hour to be done!

*AOC 5:* Unfortunately this was the first AOC that I was unable to finish(kinda), thanks to a commitment that went on late into the night(limiting my time to solve the problem), combined with a misinterpretation of the scale of the problem to be solved, I ended up writing an algorithm for part-01 that passed the example test and would probably also pass the real test, but it cannot due to performance issues/poor optimization.

It didn't take long for me to understand my mistake and how I could fix it, but as I said, my time was already tight.

That's why I decided to just accept L this time and maybe fix this algorithm another day. :/

Just in case I made you curious: I started the actual testing of the solution at approximately ~23:30 on the first day and by ~13:00 the next day the test still hadn't processed all of the problem input.

*AOC 6:* Nothing special about this puzzle but I found it very funny how part-02 could be solved without changing any key functions of part-01.

*AOC 7:* I have to admit, this one made me laugh at myself... The first part didn't seem difficult and it wasn't but it made me write a lot of tiny functions, on the other hand it made the second part completely ease to solve with some replaceAll().

*AOC 8:* part-01 solution was straightforward, part-02 requested a little help to be solved tho
